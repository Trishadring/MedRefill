## Medication Reminder App

The worst thing about taking medication daily is remembering when you have to fill your medicaiton. Different medications are with different doctors or pharmacies and have different rules about when and how you can fill them. Medfill lets you keep track of all your medications in one place. You can see when you have to fill each med and even what doctor or pharmacy to call for a refill!
